# 1.2 composition
#golang

## You have a response struct which you would like customise with more fields

`
type Response struct {
    Name string
    Age int
}

type CustomResponse struct {
    Response
    Data string
}

We are composing Response into CustomResponse and can access response fields directly from the instance of CustomResponse, 
e.g.

    cr := CustomResponse

    cr.Name // as if part of Response
    cr.Response.Name // or via full path


## Goroutines can not return anything

You can have goroutines with return values but can not be used.
Therefore you must use channels to communicate with goroutines to pass and fetch data.

## Concurrency

Channels can be read-only and write only based on where '<-' operator is positioned.
if it's chan is on right its read-only, if its on the left of chan, its write-only

func readChannel(ch <-chan int) {
	// ch is read-only
}

func writeChannel(ch chan<- int) {
	// ch is write-only
}
