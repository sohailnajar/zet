# init in golang

init is initialised first, even before main if main is defined. but main does not have to be defined.

In case init is defined in a package, it will called when package is imported.

init can be defined multiple times.

in a same file, it will be executed in order it is encountered.

If it is defined across multiple files in a package, filename order would determine the execution order.

Avoid multiple files as change in file name would alter the order of init execution..

init can also be used for side efects of the package.
