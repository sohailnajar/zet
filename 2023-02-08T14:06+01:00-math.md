discuss some techniques that helped my students improve the way they study the math they need as developers.

So, what's going on here? We know the content is there, right? After all, many reputable institutions and successful students have been using these books. So, why is it that we cannot evolve from reading those math books?

In my experience, some of the reasons are:

Our lack of experience with math jargon and math notation, which is something most rigorous math books expect from their readers.
Not enough practical examples, which needs to be something more attractive than problems involving money, percentages, a rolling dice, or decks of cards.
The temptation of studying advanced topics without having a strong grasp of the fundamentals.

One of the most important challenges that any beginner math students face is to overcome the temptation of looking at a math problem as just a bunch of symbols and rules. 

This distance between symbols and their real meaning is one of the reasons students struggle to digest the contents of resources that use math notation.

If you catch yourself thinking only in terms of rules that you apply on symbols, like when you say "here I can cross 
 with 
 ", that's when you need to stop and rewind! It does not matter how simple an equation looks, force yourself to find the meaning behind it.
